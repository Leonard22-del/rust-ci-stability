Title: Stabilize Rust CI by mitigating OOM and disk pressure

Summary:
Intermittent Rust cargo build/test failures were occurring due to
memory exhaustion during parallel compilation and disk pressure
from stale build artifacts.

Evidence:
- CI diagnostics showed limited RAM and disk on the runner
- Failures ended with "Killed" / LLVM crashes consistent with OOM
- Large target/ directories contributed to disk pressure

Changes:
- Added GitHub Actions workflow with system diagnostics
- Cleaned stale build artifacts before builds
- Limited cargo parallelism (CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2, test-threads=1)
- Added repeat test execution to validate stability
- Added persistent repo config via .cargo/config.toml

Validation:
- CI workflow passes consistently
- cargo test executed multiple times without failure
- No OOM or disk saturation observed in post-run diagnostics

Notes:
- Swapfile is best-effort on GitHub-hosted runners
- Persistent swap is recommended for self-hosted runners
